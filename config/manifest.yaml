# config/manifest.yaml
#
# 📌 Manifest File — Main entrypoint for project orchestration.
#
# This file declares which networks to create, where to find their configs,
# and how to apply global defaults and devices.
#
# ✅ `defaults`: points to a YAML file that defines fallback configuration values.
# ✅ `devices`: points to a central device inventory.
# ✅ `projects`: declares all orgs and networks to build.
#
# 🔁 Each `project` represents a Meraki organization.
# 🔁 Each `network` within a project defines one network to be created.
#
# 🔗 Each network can optionally load specific configs (firewall, routes, VLANs, etc.).
# 🔗 These override global `defaults.yaml` values or `common/` shared files.

# 📍 Global defaults used across all projects
defaults: defaults.yaml

# 🧾 Central device registry (grouped via tag)
devices: devices/devices.yaml

# 🧱 Project-by-project declarations
