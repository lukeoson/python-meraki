# This file controls the % of addresses reserved for DHCP exclusions per VLAN.
# Key = VLAN name. Value = exclusion ratio (0.0â€“1.0).
# Example:
# MGMT: 0.5    # 50% of usable IPs reserved for manual IPs
# Internal: 0.25  # 25% reserved
#
# If a VLAN is missing from this file, it defaults to 25% reservation.

MGMT: 0.5
